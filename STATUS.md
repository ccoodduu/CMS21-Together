Newest first. One entry per work session.

- Forked upstream `Dev` into our `main`; OpenSpec 1.14 set up with project context and `openspec/ROADMAP.md`.
- Test harness works end to end: two hard-linked test installs, local dedicated server, `TogetherTestHarness`
  mod (command file, status/dump JSON, screenshots, mute, skips intro + start screen), `Run-Session.ps1`
  with save/registry backup + restore. A connect run takes ~2 min.
- `connect` scenario: both clients reach the garage with identical stats/inventory/cars.
- Bug found: a late joiner never sees an idle player. `Movement.UpdateMovement` only sends on change and
  remote players spawn on the first `MovementPacket`. Belongs to `sync-players-and-scenes`.
- Seven OpenSpec changes being drafted (one per roadmap row).
