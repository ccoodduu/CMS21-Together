## 2026-10-06 (night, with the user) — planning done

- Seven changes drafted, each reviewed, then one integration pass; workshop split into `sync-workshop-machines`
  and `sync-workshop-car-tools` → 8 changes, all `openspec validate --all --strict`. Cross-change matrix in
  `openspec/INTEGRATION.md`; each change has a `review.md`.
- Roadmap reviewed: milestones M0–M6, sizes, spikes, working rules; new rows 13–16.
- User decisions in `QUESTIONS.md` (four rounds). Key: shared progression, game logic moves server-side
  (row 16, game gets no more updates), outdoor scenes via adapted LvxBetterCarSpawns (row 15).
- Next: M0 — `session-persistence-and-rejoin` groups 1–2 (contract), then groups 6 and 3; spikes in the
  background (part identity, native decompile).

## 2026-10-05 (evening, with the user)

- Forked upstream `Dev` into our `main`; OpenSpec 1.14 set up with project context and `openspec/ROADMAP.md`.
- Test harness works end to end: two hard-linked test installs, local dedicated server, `TogetherTestHarness`
  mod (command file, status/dump JSON, screenshots, mute, skips intro + start screen), `Run-Session.ps1`
  with save/registry backup + restore. A connect run takes ~2 min.
- `connect` scenario: both clients reach the garage with identical stats/inventory/cars.
- Bug found: a late joiner never sees an idle player. `Movement.UpdateMovement` only sends on change and
  remote players spawn on the first `MovementPacket`. Belongs to `sync-players-and-scenes`.
- Seven OpenSpec changes being drafted (one per roadmap row).
