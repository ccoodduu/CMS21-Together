# Questions for the user

Open questions that block a decision. Each has the default we work with until answered.
Answered ones move to the bottom with the answer.

## Open — smaller, defaults probably fine

- Remote players see only the finished part state, not the bolt animation, while a part is reserved.
- When two players edit the same car-detail section at once, the last write wins.
- Whoever spawns a car decides its random values (damage, colour…).
- A joining player's own local-save cars are dropped while connected; the server's cars are shown.
- Order generation runs on one elected client (lowest player id) because the server has no game code.
- Payout/XP reported by the finishing client is trusted (with bounds checks).
- Steam achievements/stats for a finished job go to the player who finishes it.
- Barn: other players are hidden (its layout differs per visit).
- A seated player's avatar is hidden instead of posed.
- Player name comes from a mod setting (no in-game UI yet).
- Engine stand 2 is synced like stand 1; disabled while connected if that fails.
- While connected, taking a car out from the separate Parking scene is blocked (garage parking works).
- No automatic reconnect after a server restart; a server that cannot load its save refuses to start.

Answered by the user on 2026-10-05:

1. **Level, XP and skills: shared or per player?** Shared, as in Dev today (one `WorldState`). Per-player
   data is only identity, name, position/scene.
2. **Start from an existing single-player save?** Maybe a later feature (backlog), not now.
3. **Cars bought outside the garage** always go to the shared parking. Yes.
4. **Order expiry** pauses while nobody is connected. Yes.
5. **Story missions** synced like normal orders. Yes. Tutorial: make it multiplayer only if cheap; otherwise
   drop the tutorial from multiplayer games (decision: drop it now, multiplayer tutorial is backlog).
6. **Wheel balancer minigame** is kept (not skipped). Yes.
