# Questions for the user

Open questions that block a decision. Each has the default we work with until answered.
Answered ones move to the bottom with the answer.

## Open — smaller, defaults probably fine

- Remote players see only the finished part state, not the bolt animation, while a part is reserved.
- When two players edit the same car-detail section at once, the last write wins.
- Whoever spawns a car decides its random values (damage, colour…).
- A joining player's own local-save cars are dropped while connected; the server's cars are shown.
- Order generation runs on one elected client (lowest player id) because the server has no game code.
- Payout/XP reported by the finishing client is trusted (with bounds checks).
- Steam achievements/stats for a finished job go to the player who finishes it.
- Barn: other players are hidden (its layout differs per visit).
- A seated player's avatar is hidden instead of posed.
- Player name comes from a mod setting (no in-game UI yet).
- Engine stand 2 is synced like stand 1; disabled while connected if that fails.
- While connected, taking a car out from the separate Parking scene is blocked (garage parking works).
- No automatic reconnect after a server restart; a server that cannot load its save refuses to start.

## Answered

Answered by the user on 2026-10-05:

1. **Level, XP and skills: shared or per player?** Shared, as in Dev today (one `WorldState`). Per-player
   data is only identity, name, position/scene.
2. **Start from an existing single-player save?** Maybe a later feature (backlog), not now.
3. **Cars bought outside the garage** always go to the shared parking. Yes.
4. **Order expiry** pauses while nobody is connected. Yes.
5. **Story missions** synced like normal orders. Yes. Tutorial: make it multiplayer only if cheap; otherwise
   drop the tutorial from multiplayer games (decision: drop it now, multiplayer tutorial is backlog).
6. **Wheel balancer minigame** is kept (not skipped). Yes.

Second round (2026-10-05):

- Tutorial: disabled in multiplayer (confirmed).
- Remote bolt/part animation: user asked how hard → planned as polish after M2 (visual-only replay).
- Two players on the same car: yes — already the design (only the same part at the same time is reserved).
- Random values of a spawned car: the server decides which client's roll counts (it cannot roll itself: the
  game's generation code is native). Same principle for order generation and job payout: the server owns and
  validates the result; computing it server-side would mean re-implementing hidden native game logic (revisit later).
- Joining player's local-save cars are not shown while connected: ok.
- Steam achievements/stats for a finished job: ALL connected players get them.
- Shared junkyard/barn ("scavenge together"): wanted → new ROADMAP row 15 `shared-outdoor-scenes` (after M4).
  Until then: barn hides other players (ok for now).
- Seated player hidden instead of posed: ok. Name from config until the UI exists: ok.
- Engine stand 2 synced like stand 1, disabled while connected if unstable: ok (explained to user).
- Parking scene blocked while connected: ok for now. No auto-reconnect; unloadable save refuses to start: ok.
- Playtest with a friend: later, date unknown.
- DLC: nobody owns any DLC → the handshake just compares DLC sets.
- Mods: for now no gameplay mods, only visual mods → row 9 checks only mods that change gameplay
  (server-configured required/ignored lists + Harmony patch-target heuristic), visual mods are ignored.
- Difficulty: chosen on the server; sandbox skipped for now.
